If a certain string is found anywhere in a tab title, a specific color will be applied. The intention is to make tabs a bit easier to organize based off your different types of scripts.\n\nBasically, you get to differentiate among different tabs based off your own rules. Color them based off extension, or purpose. For example:\n\n`.js` will match JavaScript files\n`Service` will match your Services, like `ChatService`, `UserService`, etc.\n\nMore to come! I'd like to set up an actual configuration feature. Right now you need to edit the file `~/.atom/packages/lucid-tabs/styles/lucid-tabs.less` to change color and string matching rules.\n\n--------------------------\n\nForked from graemeboy/rainbow-tabs (thanks!)\n\n![A screenshot of rainbow extensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmai/lucid-tabs/master/resources/screenshot1.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nmai/lucid-tabs/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nmai/lucid-tabs#readme","_id":"lucid-tabs@1.1.1","_shasum":"4e15ee9d23f701277bff98d34b69291aa39e818c","_resolved":"file:../d-116222-37264-mjbnri/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116222-37264-mjbnri/package.tgz"}
